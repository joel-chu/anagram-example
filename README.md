# Anagram example

Just a few example of anagram using several different computer languages.
It's quite a good example to show the different between languages.

This was developed on Pop-os (Ubuntu 20.10).

## Examples

They will all be one liner to execute in the following format

```sh
$ [lang-ex] [path/to/script] [input]
```

## Javascript

No dependencies, just need node.js installed (>= 12.x)

Run it from the command line, the first following word will be the input.

```sh
$ node ./js/anagram.js abort
```

## Python

```sh
$ python3 ./python/anagram.py abort
```

If you have `python-is-python3` (on Ubuntu / Debian) then just `python`

##  Java

Coming soon.
